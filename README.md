# Hangman
Hangman is a well-known game that is usually played on a piece of paper.
You play when a person has a word in their mind and the other person tries to guess, with one letter or the whole word. 

## Compile source code 

First of all, you need rust installed you can find out how [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) you also need the code on your computer.... duh.

With Rust installed you have access to a lot of new commands which are required.

To build the code you need to open the CMD or Terminal in the root of the folder. Then you can run `cargo build --release` to build the binary to your own OS. 

Rust supports cross-compile but that is out of the scope of this manual check the WIKI for more information on that subject.
